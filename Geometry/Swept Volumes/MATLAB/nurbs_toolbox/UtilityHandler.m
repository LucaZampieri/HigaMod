    %% UTILITY HANDLER CLASS
    % The UtilityHandler class is responsible for gathering all of the
    % support methods not directly involved with the solution of the
    % differential problem. Among this methods we can find methods for the
    % computation of errors and coefficients, methods for the import and
    % export of files during the computations and different kinds of
    % plotting information.

        %%  UTILITY HANDLER - OBJECT PROPERTIES
        % The properties of the objects used in the UtilityHandler
        % encapsulate all of the variables needed to run the methods 
        % associated with the support methods available for the
        % differential problems proposed. They basically represent all of
        % the variables required implement the methods proposed and are
        % separated in the different functionalities presented bellow.
